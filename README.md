# Security Simple Ciphers Program
By Peter Vukas for Sister Jane's Security Class
## Features
### Frequency Analysis
Frequency analysis tool which shows the frequency of all letters in a given cipher text
Analyzer has a built in decryption test for Substitution ciphers
### Simple Substitution
Allows for both Encryption and Decryption of alphabetic characters
### Caesar Shift
Allows for Encryption and Decryption of alphabetic characters via shifting
## Requirements
All plain and cipher text must be alphabetical characters only. No spaces, or any other characters are permitted.
Caesar keys must be integers. Keys of the value 0, multiples of 26, or negative values will result in a resulting "Encryption" with no change.
Substitution keys must contain all letters of the alphabet only. Each letter must represented once.
